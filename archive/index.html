            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>DesSoc is the social society branched from the Dyson School of Design Engineering. We aim to provide our members (if you study in the Dyson School you already are!) extracurricular and social events to further broaden their experience whilst they study at Imperial.

            One of the most important jobs we do each year is to organise the Mums and Dads initiative run by most departments across Imperial. We want to ensure that all freshmen students join the department in the best way possible, so throughout the year we will run ‘Family’ events to help integrate them into the DesEng family.

            Throughout the year we run a variety of events such as bar nights, pub crawls, dinners (including the end-of-year party), film nights, football, quiz nights and professional talks from links to alumni and industry. We’re also planning on bringing bigger events and even a DesEng trip as our school gets bigger! We hope you have a fantastic year.

            To keep informed on all our latest events join our Facebook group here:

            Please do get in touch if you have any questions, either with a particular member of the committee (see below) or email dessoc@imperial.ac.uk for general enquiries.
